An unofficial WordPress plugin that enables the use of Hypermedia on your WordPress site, theme, and/or plugins. Intended for software developers.

== Description ==
An unofficial WordPress plugin that enables the use of Hypermedia on WordPress. Adds a new endpoint `/wp-htmx/v1/` from which you can load any Hypermedia template.

Hypermedia is a concept that extends the idea of hypertext by allowing for more complex interactions and data representations. It enables the use of AJAX, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events directly in HTML using attributes, without writing any JavaScript. It reuses an "old" concept, [Hypermedia](https://hypermedia.systems/), to handle the modern web in a more HTML-like and natural way.

Check the [full feature set at here](https://github.com/EstebanForge/Hypermedia-API-WordPress).

This plugin include several Hypermedia libraries by default, locally from the plugin folder. Currently, it includes:

- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) with [Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/).
- [Alpine Ajax](https://alpine-ajax.js.org/) with [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/).
- [Datastar](https://data-star.dev/).

The plugin has an opt-in option, not enforced, to include these third-party libraries from a CDN (using the unpkg.com service). You must explicitly enable this option for privacy and security reasons.
